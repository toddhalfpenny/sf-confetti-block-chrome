# SF Confetti Block Chrome

![alt text](images/icon128.png "Logo for Salesforce Confetti Block")

Chrome browser extension to hide all Salesforce celebration confetti.

This is built for grumpy folk like me, who don't want to see confetti, and has been made as there is no way to turn it off on a per user basis.

This extension matches on all https://*.force.com URLs.

## Installation

I've not put this onto the Chrome Extension store yet, so you'll have to install it like this;

1. Clone or download this repo
1. Go to [chrome://extensions](chrome://extensions) in your Chrome browser
1. Enable "Developer mode"
1. Click "Load unpacked" and select the folder that contains the cloned/downloaded git repository.
